# Responsive images


* A first options that seems good as a first approach : 
  * https://dev.to/khalyomede/create-responsive-images-with-gulp-sharp-responsive-9c6
  * https://github.com/khalyomede/gulp-sharp-responsive
  * It is recent: from 2021
  * It includes generating all formats for a source file : expecially to generate the `webp` format, which is demanded by the lighthouse standard
  * It shows how to make responsive pictures with HTML : 
    * the way to do that is not using `srcset`
    * it is using the `<picture>` HTML Tag.
  * It has only a few stars, but i'm almost sure it uses a very, very popular project https://github.com/lovell/sharp
